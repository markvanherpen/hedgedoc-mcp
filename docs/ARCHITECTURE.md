# Architecture

This project has three layers, each independently usable:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MCP layer (server.py)                       │
│  6 tools exposed via stdio JSON-RPC           │
│  Used by: Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, etc.    │
└───────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                     │
┌────────────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
│  Config/auth layer (auth.py)                     │
│  Env var parsing + cookie-first,                 │
│  login-fallback authentication strategy          │
└────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                     │
┌────────────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
│  HTTP client layer (client.py)                   │
│  Plain requests.Session wrapper around            │
│  HedgeDoc's real (undocumented-as-REST) endpoints │
│  Zero MCP/env dependencies -- usable standalone   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Why three layers, not one file

- **`client.py` has zero MCP dependencies.** You can `pip install
  hedgedoc-mcp` and use `HedgeDocClient` directly in a script, a cron job,
  a Jupyter notebook — anything — without ever touching the MCP protocol.
  This is deliberate: the hard part of this project is correctly handling
  HedgeDoc 1.x's session-cookie auth, and that value shouldn't be locked
  behind an MCP-only interface.

- **`auth.py` is the policy layer.** It decides *how* to authenticate
  (cookie-first, login-fallback) based on what env vars are present, but
  doesn't know anything about MCP or HTTP details. This is what makes
  `SessionExpiredError` handling automatic instead of something every
  caller has to reimplement.

- **`server.py` is a thin MCP adapter.** It translates 6 tool calls into
  `client.py` method calls and formats results as `TextContent`. It
  contains exactly one piece of "real" logic: catching
  `SessionExpiredError` and retrying once after forcing a fresh
  `build_client()` call, so a single expired-cookie hiccup during a long
  agent session self-heals instead of failing the tool call outright.

## Authentication flow in detail

              │  client   │             │
              └───────────┘         Yes / No
                                     │      │
                          ┌──────────▼──┐  ┌▼─────────────┐
                          │ client.login│  │ raise         │

                          └─────────────┘  └───────────────┘
```

This is why setting **both** the session cookie and email/password is the
recommended production setup: the cookie makes every normal call fast
(zero extra login round-trip), while email/password makes expiry a
non-event instead of an outage.

## Why HedgeDoc 1.x specifically (not 2.x)

HedgeDoc 2.x (still in active development at the time of writing) has a
genuinely different, token-friendlier API design. This project targets
1.x because:

1. It's what's actually deployed on the vast majority of self-hosted
   instances today (including the one this was built and tested against —
   HedgeDoc 1.11.1).
2. 1.x's constraints (no tokens, no generic update endpoint) are exactly
   the kind of "annoying but well-understood" problem that's worth solving
   once, generically, so nobody else has to re-discover it via trial and
   error.

If/when 2.x API-token support becomes the norm, this project would ideally
grow a second, simpler auth backend behind the same `HedgeDocClient`
interface — contributions welcome (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Testing strategy

All 25 tests in `tests/` mock `requests.Session` methods directly (no
`responses`/`httpretty` library, no live server) so the suite runs in
under a second with zero external dependencies. This was a deliberate
choice to keep CI fast and to make the auth fallback logic
(`build_client`'s cookie→login flow) easy to test in isolation —
see `tests/test_auth.py` for the four `build_client` scenarios (valid
cookie, expired cookie + fallback, expired cookie + no fallback, no
cookie at all).

Live end-to-end verification (this project's server actually creating,
reading, and updating notes on a real HedgeDoc instance, including a full
MCP stdio JSON-RPC handshake) was performed manually during development
against a live instance rather than committed as a test, since it requires
real credentials. If you're contributing and want to add an opt-in
live-integration test suite gated behind env vars, see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
